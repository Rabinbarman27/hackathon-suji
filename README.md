## 🚀 About

Welcome to **StudyHub**! This project is a lightweight, frontend-only web application that functions as a personal dashboard for students. It integrates proven study techniques like **Pomodoro**, **Active Recall**, and **Spaced Repetition** to help users stay organized and productive without the distraction of complex tools.

## ✨ Features

- **⏱️ Study Timer**: Built-in timer to manage study sessions effectively.
- **📊 Progress Tracking**: Visualize study habits over time with interactive Chart.js graphs.
- **📚 Study Methods**: Quick guides on effective techniques to improve learning.
- **🏆 Gamification**: Earn points for every 30 minutes of studying to stay motivated.
- **🔒 Local Privacy**: All data is stored locally in your browser—no accounts or servers needed!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with **Vanilla Web Technologies**, intentionally avoiding complex frameworks to make it perfect for beginners learning the fundamentals.

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox and Grid.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic, interactivity, and state management.
- **Chart.js**: Beautiful, responsive data visualization.
- **LocalStorage**: Persistent client-side data storage.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, only for development/build tools)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rabinbarman27/hackathonSujj.git
    cd hackathonSujj
    ```

2.  **Run Locally**:
    You can simply open `index.html` in your browser.
    
    OR, for a better experience using the included dev server:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    This will start a local server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 💻 Development

If you are a student developer looking to learn from this codebase, this section is for you! We've designed the code to be readable and modular.

### Project Structure

```text
├── index.html          # Login Page (Entry Point)
├── script.js           # Login Logic
├── signup.html         # Registration Page
├── dashboard.html      # Main Dashboard (Study Hub)
├── dashboard.js        # Dashboard Logic (Navigation, Auth Check)
├── study-methods.html  # Information about study techniques
├── notes.html          # Simple Notepad
├── progress.html       # Timer & Progress Charts
├── progress.js         # Core Timer Logic & Data Saving
└── dist/               # Build output (generated by npm run build)
```

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Authentication (Mock)
We use a simple "mock" authentication system. Instead of talking to a server, we save the user's credentials in `localStorage`.
*See `script.js` for implementation details.*

#### 2. Data Persistence
The app remembers your progress using the browser's `localStorage` API.
- `isLoggedIn`: Status flag.
- `points`: Earned score.
- `studyProgress`: JSON object identifying study minutes by date.

#### 3. Navigation
Multipage navigation is handled via standard `window.location.href` redirects.

### 🐛 Contributing (Good First Issues)
Want to contribute? Here are some ideas:
1.  **Ephemeral Notes**: Fix `notes.js` to save notes to `localStorage` so they don't disappear on refresh.
2.  **Security Improvements**: Implement better handling for credentials (currently plain text).
3.  **UI Polish**: Improve the responsiveness of the dashboard on mobile devices.

## ☁️ Deployment

This project is optimized for **Vercel**.

1.  **Build Command**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    *This acts as a clean build, removing the old `dist` folder and generating a fresh one.*

2.  **Output Directory**: `dist`

Simply push your changes to the `main` branch, and Vercel will automatically build and deploy using the configuration in `vercel.json`.
