# StudyHub (migrated to React + Vite)

This repo is a migration of the original static site into a small React app bootstrapped with Vite.

Quick commands

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

Deployment

- Vercel: the repo includes `vercel.json` configured to rewrite all routes to `index.html` for SPA routing. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `dist` on Vercel.

Notes

- Local data (accounts, progress) is stored in `localStorage` for demo purposes.
- Before committing again, avoid committing `node_modules` and `dist` (see `.gitignore`).
# 🎓 StudyHub - Hackathon Suji

Welcome to **StudyHub**, a smart, web-based study companion designed to help students manage their study sessions effectively using proven techniques like Pomodoro, Active Recall, and Spaced Repetition.

## 🚀 Overview

StudyHub is a lightweight, frontend-only web application. It functions as a personal dashboard where students can:
- **Track Study Time**: Use a built-in timer for study sessions.
- **Visualize Progress**: See study habits over time with interactive charts.
- **Learn Methods**: Get quick guides on effective study techniques.
- **Gamification**: Earn points for every 30 minutes of studying.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with **Vanilla Web Technologies**, making it perfect for beginners to understand the fundamentals of web development without the complexity of frameworks.

- **HTML5**: For structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling (including Flexbox/Grid for layout).
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For logic, interactivity, and data management.
- **Chart.js**: For rendering the beautiful progress graphs.
- **LocalStorage**: To save user data directly in the browser (no backend required!).

## 💻 Developer Student Guide

If you are a student developer looking to learn from this codebase, this section is for you! We've designed the code to be readable and modular. Here is a breakdown of how it works.

### 📂 Project Structure

```text
├── index.html          # Login Page (Entry Point)
├── script.js           # Login Logic
├── signup.html         # Registration Page
├── dashboard.html      # Main Dashboard (Study Hub)
├── dashboard.js        # Dashboard Logic (Navigation, Auth Check)
├── study-methods.html  # Information about study techniques
├── notes.html          # Simple Notepad
├── progress.html       # Timer & Progress Charts
├── progress.js         # Core Timer Logic & Data Saving
└── dist/               # Build output (generated by npm run build)
```

### 🔑 Key Concepts Explained

#### 1. Authentication (Mock)
We use a simple "mock" authentication system. Instead of talking to a server, we save the user's credentials in the browser's `localStorage`.

*See `script.js`*:
```javascript
// Saving a user
const user = { email, password };
localStorage.setItem("studentUser", JSON.stringify(user));

// Checking login
const savedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("studentUser"));
if (inputEmail === savedUser.email) { ... }
```
**Challenge for You**: Try adding a "Forgot Password" feature!

#### 2. Data Persistence (LocalStorage)
The app feels like it remembers you because we use `localStorage`. This is a key-value store in your browser.

*   `isLoggedIn`: "true" or "false".
*   `points`: Integer number of points earned.
*   `studyProgress`: A JSON object tracking minutes studied by date and mode.

*See `progress.js` (Line 41)*:
```javascript
function saveProgress(minutes) {
  let progress = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("studyProgress")) || {};
  // ... update logic ...
  localStorage.setItem("studyProgress", JSON.stringify(progress));
}
```

#### 3. Navigation
Since this is a multi-page site (not a Single Page App), navigation is handled by standard HTML links or JavaScript redirection.

```javascript
window.location.href = "dashboard.html"; // Redirects user
```

### 🐛 Known Limitations (Good First Issues!)
This project is a perfect starting point. Here are things *you* can fix or improve:

1.  **Ephemeral Notes**: The logic in `notes.js` appends notes to the screen but *doesn't save them* to `localStorage`. If you refresh `notes.html`, your notes disappear! **Task**: Implement `saveNotes` using `localStorage` so they persist.
2.  **Security**: The passwords are stored in plain text in the browser. In a real app, you would never do this!
3.  **Chart Library**: We use Chart.js, but make sure the script tag is properly included in all pages that need it.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rabinbarman27/hackathonSujj.git
    cd hackathonSujj
    ```

2.  **Open in Browser**:
    Simply open `index.html` in your Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browser.

    *Optional (for better experience)*: Use a live server (like VS Code Live Server extension) or Python simple http server:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```

3.  **Build (for Deployment)**:
    If you want to prepare the files for deployment (e.g., Vercel):
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a `dist/` folder with all necessary files.

## ☁️ Deployment

This project is configured for **Vercel**.
- The `vercel.json` and `package.json` are set up to deploy the `dist` folder.
- Simply push your changes to the `main` branch, and Vercel will automatically build and deploy.
